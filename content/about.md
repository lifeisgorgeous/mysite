## Hi there!

This is Solaiman Hridoy, a final year Computer Science and Engineering student currently enrolled at USTC with an interest in Programming, Problem Solving, Software Developing, and Data Science.

I am a self-motivated young man from a small town called Chittagong, the Port City of Bangladesh who is passionately trying to be a better version of himself every day.

Being a student of Computer Science and Engineering, I always try to give focus on developing skills related to my degree. But I love to explore and perceive the world of knowledge and wisdom from other subjects too. Music and Programming are my passions. In my off times, I love to make music, write poems, songs, travel new places, and love to contribute as a volunteer.

I love to see things from different perspectives. I always appreciate positive minds cause I believe a positive and determined view can solve a tough problem. I enjoy talking about ideas and opportunities.

Mistakes and problems are the best sources to learn new smart things. I love to deal with them. Cause I love learning!

All my favorite teachers, my family, and my friends are always in my reminders. Here thatâ€™s a very short summary about me! My blogs will tell you more about me and about my activities. Enjoy the visits!
