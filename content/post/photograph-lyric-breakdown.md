Ed Sheeran's 5th radio single "Photograph" is from his album called 'X'. Regarding the single Ed said, “It will be the one that will change my career path”, and hopes it will sell the album “even if the rest of the album is shit”. 

This song was written by Ed Sheeran alongside with the help of Johnny McDaid. Ed tried to tell the perception of his love towards his loved one in those photographs they had taken. He perceived those photographs with those beautiful thoughts so that the affections and the fragrances of their romance will remain in those photographs forever. Thanks to Ed Sheeran for giving us such a creation. This is just not only a song but also a philosophical food that gives a great vibe to remember some old memories.

I tried to cover this song! Listen and Enjoy! As I am a huge fan of Ed Sheeran and often I love to sing and humming all Ed's songs all day long I decided to cover and publish this song and my thoughts about the song by writing a blog. 

### Why this song is so special to me?

Well, Ed wrote it for telling his very own story with his loved one on the other side for me, this song is far more than that! I just love the perception of this song with my heart and soul. I liked so much his philosophy about photographs. In pre-chorus some lines are like this:

> We keep this love in a photograph
>
> We make these memories for ourselves
>
> Where our eyes are never closing, Our hearts were never broken
>
> And time's forever frozen still.

Ah! These lines perfectly define why most of us love to take photographs. Personally, I love so much to take photographs of special moments of mine with friends n family and upload them with heavy cares and loves into my cloud folders! I have a huge collection of photo albums from my childhood to this young-hood! Often I dive into the sea of my old memories with those photographs.

Then the two verses from the song:

> [Verse - 1]
>
> Loving can hurt, Loving can hurt sometimes
>
> But it's the only thing that I know. 
>
> And when it gets hard
>
> You know it can get hard sometimes
>
> But, It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.

> [Verse - 2]
>
> Loving can heal, Loving can mend your soul
>
> And is the only thing, that I know (know)
>
> I swear it will get easier
>
> Remember that with every piece of ya
>
> And it's the only thing we take with us when we die.

These two verses tell two sides of love - 'hurt' and 'heal'. In the first verse, Ed wrote about the hurting side of love but still, he believes that love is the only thing that makes us feel alive. Then in the second verse, he wrote about the healing side of love where he tried to convince his lover that he will be alright and will remember his lover through those photographs. Cause love is the thing that we take with us when we die. 

I'm sure most of us can relate to these words and finally, the song also got a big hit in the year 2015.
